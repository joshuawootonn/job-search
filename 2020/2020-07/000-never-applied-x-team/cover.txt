It's really refreshing to see a company that believe in finding inspiration from who and what you are surrounded by. 
My most industrious times have always followed times where I was inundated with new culture and new nature. 
X-Team's commitment to a lifestyle that combines these two with everyday life is exciting to me!

Why would you hire me? 

> Solid experience with React and Redux
once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my React skills were "Godlike"

> Passion for creating UX/UI mockups.
yes, at my current position I am the interim UX designer

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am really looking forward to learning more about X-Team
