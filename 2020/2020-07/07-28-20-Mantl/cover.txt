It's really refreshing to see that Mantl considers people it's most import asset. 
Between your bio and Vidaloka for header font on your home page, I can tell I will integrate well. 

Why would you hire me? 

> You have an eye for strong design
yes, at my current position I am the interim UX designer

> You are a Javascript expert
once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my Javascript skills were "Godlike"


I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am really looking forward to learning more about Mantl
