My favorite thing about spotify is music discovery, personalization seems to be the best way to have an impact on making music discovery even better. This is why I am interested.

Why would you be interested in me?

> You are proficient in some of the following: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Styled Components.
not only do I use this stack professionally right now, but I have 3 personal projects that are currently using it!

> Collaborate and pair program in a cross-functional team
yes, I reach out to people daily, to see if I can help them out. I believe this goes both way though, so when I am stuck my first instinct is to get a pair partner

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am really looking forward to learning more about the personalization team at Spotify
