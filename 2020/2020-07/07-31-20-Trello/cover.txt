I remember four years ago when I was introduced to Trello for the first time. I have been using it since,
and have recommended it to people I was studying with, group project partners, coworkers, and most recently to my wife.

Not only has Trello made a great product, they've made a cute doggy that brings updates, they've made personalization features that enrich human interaction, they've made something, that makes work, a little more fun. That is something I want to be apart of!

Why would you want to hire me? Well, on top of being versed in React, Node.js, and the rest of your stack, I love Trello.
