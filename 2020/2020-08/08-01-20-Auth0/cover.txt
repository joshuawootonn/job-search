It's really refreshing to read about Auth0's culture, specifically it's emphasis on team development and open communication.
My experience has backed up other parts of your core, like the fact that you give a shit. That is why I want to work for Auth0!

Why would you hire me?

> Enjoy building elegant user interface and best user experience
yes, at my current position I am the interim UX designer

> Have a deep understanding of JavaScript
once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my Javascript skills were "Godlike"

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am looking forward to learning more about the Ecosystem team at Auth0
