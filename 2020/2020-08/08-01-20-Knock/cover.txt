It's really refreshing to see that Knock values passion, transparency, and people first. Sounds like a culture aimed at success for it's employees and itself. Something I want to be apart of.

Why would you hire me?

> Build and maintain compelling experiences ... using ReactJS.
I am proficient with React and have experience with other parts of your stack like Next.js and Docker

> Strong sense of design and UX.
yes, at my current position I am the interim UX designer

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am really looking forward to learning more about Knock
