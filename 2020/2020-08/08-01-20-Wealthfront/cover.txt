Hi Weston, 

I realize you don't have any open Frontend Engineer roles, but I wanted to PM you anyways because I am very interesting in Wealthfront.

Why am I interested?

I read A Random Walk Down Wallstreet last summer and was inspired. I felt empowered to invest on my own, but wanted to be lazer focused on growing technically, 
so I invested through Wealthfront. I have been super impressed since then. Not only have my investments blossomed, but your user journey is delightful. 
I'll put it this way: I want to work with the people that made such a good product.

Why should you give me a shot? 

> I have a strong eye for design
  1. I have been working hand in hand with a designer for the past year and recently I have taken his place as the interim UX designer.
  2. I freelance web design so even in my free time I am howning those skills (check it out https://joshuawootonn.com)

> I have a strong grasp of the js and the web
  1. Once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my Javascript skills were "Godlike"
  2. I am proficient at TS and React

Full disclosure I am looking for remote work, and according to review by my mentor and a recent technical interview I am a strong mid-level frontend engineer.

If you made it this far, thanks for giving me a shot! Check out the details in the resume attached.
