I like to say that the reason I became a frontend engineer is because I love making things look pretty. Seeing that Blameless is on a mission to focus on the end user and cause delight are why I am applying!

Why would you hire me? 

> Youâ€™re very comfortable using Typescript with React/Redux
in my previous three roles these technologies have been central

> You have a critical eye and mind for user experience and product thinking
yes, at my current position I am the interim UX designer and I moonlight Web Design/Development. you can see my work at the portfolio provided

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am looking forward to learning more about Blameless
