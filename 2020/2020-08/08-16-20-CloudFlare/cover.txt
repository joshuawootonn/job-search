I was really hesitant to apply to Cloudflare because of it's size. Here is what sold me:
* Product Stategy team seems to be on a move fast, ask for forgiveness basis
* I always say I got into Frontend because I like to make things look pretty. Based on the AD, this is something that is central to Cloudflare product vision.
* Cloudflare seems to be involved in many community based projects

Why would you hire me? 

> Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my Javascript skills were "Godlike"

> Experience building and shipping production React.js applications
yes, in May I just released another one on a team where I was one of two Frontend engineers. 
The app uses TS, implements Localization for the US and Japan, and has different themes based on your OS


I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am really looking forward to learning more about the Product Strategy team at Cloudflare
