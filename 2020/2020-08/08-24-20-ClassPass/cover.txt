It's refreshing to see people that work with excellence, while pursuing a vibrant active life outside of work.
Some of my favorite parts of ClassPass so far, are that you don't take yourselves to seriously and that you care about something I do, Fitness!

Why would you hire me? 

> Have working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and related web technologies
I am moonlighting web design / development to this end. It's given me a much wider understanding of how SSR, SSG, and other web architectures work.

> Take delight in delighting our users
Heck yeah! At my current position I am the interim UX designer. I like to make things look pretty. For me this is more than an aesthetic, it's an experience that makes the user want to come back.

> Love fitness!
Yes, I ran eight miles yesterday. Feels great to get moving and be in nature

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am looking forward to learning more about ClassPass
