What is appealing to me about Compass is the emphasis on collaboration and the excellence of your product.
I like to make things look pretty, which is a shared value with your Frontend team, and I love to learn from others and share my perspective. That's why I am applying!
 
Why should you choose me?

> Experience owning projects from beginning to end
My experiences include freelancing an entire production application, moonlighting web design and development for local creatives, and being a part of a small team that creates medical software. 
Each situation has had its challenges, and each has required ownership from me to push the product to completion. This is something I intend to bring to Compass

> Experience collaborating closely with UX 
For the past year I have worked closely with a UX designer, having long conversation about rational. UX is close to my heart, and I will up to continue this collaborative mentality in the future.

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am looking forward to learning more about Compass
