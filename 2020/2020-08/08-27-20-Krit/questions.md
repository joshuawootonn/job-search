# Questions

## Why do you want to work at Krit? *

I like to tell people that I became a frontend engineer because I like to make things look pretty. I am coming from a regulated environment, and Krit feels like an open frontier for me to flex my design chops and be surrounded by people like me.

## Describe a project you've worked on that you're proud of. How did you contribute?

I recently worked on IDx-DR. It's the first AI driven diagnostic device to be approved by the FDA. When I joined my current employment it was a Windows Forms application, that got the job done. In four days I had made a living mock of what it could be in React, and they were sold. Now over the past 6 months I have worked as the primary frontend developer, to bring that mock to life, conform to standards, and best of all, be a medical device that causes delight!

## What is one strong opinion you hold about front-end development and why?

Working or getting the job done is not good enough. There is already enough _working_ software in this world. It's time for us to make elegant software that make people feel more human.

## Describe something that has made a difference in your development process.

Switched to Webstorm and Rider last year. I had some coworkers that pushed me to not use the mouse so much, and using the two had the appeal of one keymap, since they are both from Jetbrains.

Since the switch there are so many things that Webstorm does automatically like resolving imports as you type, finding usages that is easy to configure, and removing unnecessary curly braces. Could sound like dumb stuff to some, but craftsmanship comes down to really small choices, and Webstorm helps me make those more consistently!

## Do you have an accessibility needs you'd like for us to know about in the interview process?

No
