Dear Michael Deeter and the UFG team,

	As you know, I received a competing offer from a startup. To be fully transparent it’s not as good as UFG’s, but I signed it this morning and I wanted to give you some of my rational.

	My main goal right now career-wise is to grow quickly. I will be the most junior developer in the team I am being hired onto. Additionally, I will I be working on things I have never touched before like chrome extensions and microservices.

	I think that there would have been lots of growth opportunities at UFG with Michael and the rest of the team. Ultimately, it just came down to my judgment call. I realize that can be frustrating. I apologize for the hassle. It was not malicious. I am growing a lot and I am taking a lot from this situation and how I could have navigated it better. 

	My favorite part of interviewing with UFG was meeting you all. I believe you all genuinely care about your product and each other and wish you all success in the future.

Thanks for giving me a shot!
Josh
