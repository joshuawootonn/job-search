To *Engineering Manager* and the UFG team,

I am back in the job market and was wondering if UFG would consider me again for a frontend UI role. I presume you have some questions and this letter seeks to answer those.

# Why did the other role not work out? 
As you know, I signed to a startup recently. I was prioritizing technical growth and the flashing lights of technologies that were new to me caught my eye. During the onboarding, however, it became apparent that they don’t care for their employees to the level that I am looking for and in many ways are transferring risk onto them. 

# Why am I still excited about UFG?

I’ve looked back at my notes from the interviews with UFG. One thing that’s apparent to me is that UFG does prioritize people. I believe that great products are made when the right people are aligned and empowered to create. From its actions and from the people I’ve met, I believe UFG holds that same value and I feel confident about moving forward. 


While the technical stack is different, I’m learning that the combination of fun technologies and a people-centered mindset are equally part of what I am striving to be apart of.

Looking back on it I realize I missed out on a great opportunity. If you guys will still have me, I would love to ultimately commit to UFG!


Thanks for your consideration,

Josh Wootonn
