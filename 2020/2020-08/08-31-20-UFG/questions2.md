# My why?

From what I have heard seems like an exciting and busy time. I like the idea of being able to change the face of DX at UFG. Seems like UFG cares about it's people and that they aren't just cogs in a machine, which can be hard to find.

I care deeply about what I am making and UFG seems like a place that is ready for that and wants people that will take ownership and make it their own.

# things that I learned

Seth and Dustin. Also other developers that are really experienced. Team is really strong.

Everyone is always very welcome and open. Doesn't feel different from a startup!

Great group of people.
