I am sure you will find applicants with more OS or banking experience, what sets me apart is my creative
energy and my desire to delight. I am applying to Moov, because (based on your website) I have a kindred spirit with whoever was involved.
I want to join in changing the banking industry into something beautiful.

Here are some other things about me:

> Strong knowledge and experience with modern JavaScript
once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my Javascript skills were "Godlike"

> A desire to perform and grow as an engineer
Yes! Here is what I have learned in the past year outside of work
* WebGL and PostGIS (spatial databases) to make a collabrotive paint environment.
* Figma and GatsbyJS to freelance design and web development for local businesses.
* Web animations using css, react-spring, animejs, three.js, pixi.js, and canvas to get a lay of the land.

Looking forward to learning more about Moov
