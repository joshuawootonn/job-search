"Low ego and high drive." That is something I can get behind. Nothing better than a culture of lifting others and pushing the collective forward.
SuperFormula caught my eye because of the consulting nature, the care of design, and the energy needed to get things done.

Why would you hire me? 

I freelance web design and I am the interim UX design role I am currently filling. This keep that in mind for the responses below! 

> Attention to details and striving for perfection 
Yes, I always tell people I became a frontend engineer because I like to make things look pretty.
For me this is about delighting the user and legacy maintainer.

> Ability to ensure technical feasibility of UI/UX designs
I have lived on the fringe of both the design and engineering worlds for some time now, 
and have developed a strong sense of how much design decision cost.

> Expertise in using Developer Tools for debugging, live editing, perf evaluation, JS profiling, etc
Heck yeah! I run both Firefox Developer Edition and Chrome for maximum tooling. My current favorite tool is the Animation Drawer

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am really looking forward to learning more about SuperFormula
