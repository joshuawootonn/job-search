Hi there!
 
MixPanel is exciting to me because I just stood up product analytics with Segment and got to see the difference between Amplitude and MixPanel.
The delight difference is large. MixPanel made me want to use it. So that is what brings me here, I want to work in a culture that values customer delight

Why would you hire me?
 
This past May I was apart of launching the first AI-driven diagnostic application into hospitals across the Mid-West. 
There were a lot of hurdles around making HIPAA compliant software that integrated with Hospital Systems. 
I was the only one that worked fulltime on the Electron/React frontend, and we released a solid MVP with strong best practices. 
Since our initial release, I have completely rebranded the product, designed and added a dark theme, and integrated with Segment/Mixpanel for Product Analytics.

Needless to say I know how to lead in my domain and I get results.
 
I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am looking forward to learning more about MixPanel
