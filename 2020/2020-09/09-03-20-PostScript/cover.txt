Hi there!
 
PostScript is exciting to me because
* Empathy and transparency are the driving forces in my job search and kindred values of ours
* I love working on emerging products. PostScript and the whole field itself are just that
 
 
Why would you hire me?
 
> Empathy for users when thinking about UI and UX
 
In my current position, I am the interim UX designer and I have freelanced web design in the past. Part of my motto is making things pretty and causing delight.
As such, I care about making a product that feels right, and I have the chops to pull it off.
 
 
> Passion for early-stage companies and the opportunity to be responsible for owning and improving a new, fast-growing code base
 
Not going to lie, when I saw that PostScript was founded in 2019 my initial reaction was "Aww heck yeah!"
The early stages are hectic. But if you embrace the chaos, there can be a lot of joy derived from making something out of it. That's my plan.
 
 
I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am really looking forward to learning more about PostScript
