Hi there!

This job is exciting to me because I have recently been playing around with WebGL and Three.js. 
I love creative web technologies and I am seeking to position myself into them for the future!

A little bit about me: 

This past May I was apart of launching the first FDA approved, AI-driven diagnostic application into hospitals across the Mid-West. 
There were a lot of hurdles around making HIPAA compliant software that integrated with Hospital Systems, but we were able to release a solid MVP.
I was the only one that worked fulltime on the Electron/React frontend. 
Since our initial release, I have completely rebranded the product, designed and added a dark theme, and integrated with Segment/Mixpanel for Product Analytics.

> Experience building modern web applications using React/Redux

I have experience both freelancing and collaborating in React. Additionally, I first used Redux since 2017, and I have heavily invested in this eco-system.

> Strong UI and graphic design sensibilities.

In my current position, I am the interim UX designer and I have freelanced web design in the past. Part of my motto is making things pretty and causing delight.
As such, I care about making a product that feels right, and I have the chops to pull it off.

I have more to say, but I can save it for the first interview. Thanks for your time, I look forward to learning more about this role.

P.S. There is no backend instance running, but I recently made a collabrotive drawing app (think MSPaint in the web with an infinite canvas). 
It uses three.js among other things. Check it out!
