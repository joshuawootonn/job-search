Hi there. I appreciate you looking at this cover letter and reviewing my application.

In May I was apart of a team that launched an AI-driven diagnostic application into hospitals across the Mid-West. There were a lot of hurdles around making HIPAA compliant software that integrated with Hospital Systems. I was the only one that worked fulltime on the Electron/React/Redux frontend, and we released a solid MVP with strong test coverage. Since our initial release, I have completely rebranded the product, designed and added a dark theme, and integrated with Segment/Mixpanel for Product Analytics.

Needless to say, I know how to ship a complex project and iterate it to meet customer expectations.

When people ask me why I became a frontend engineer, I usually respond to say that I "Like to make things look pretty." To me, this is more than an aesthetic. It is a flow that pleases the user and makes them want to come back. I love to delight users.

Thanks for considering me for this role. I look forward to hearing more about it.
