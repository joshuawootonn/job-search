In may I was apart of team that launched an AI-driven diagnostic application into hospitals across the Mid-West. There were a lot of hurdles around making HIPAA compliant software that integrated with Hospital Systems. I was the only one that worked fulltime on the Electron/React/Redux frontend, and we released a solid MVP with strong best practices. Since our initial release, I have completely rebranded the product, designed and added a dark theme, and integrated with Segment/Mixpanel for Product Analytics.

I have also freelanced time tracking software that uses React/Redux. It includes everything from a cloud hosted API/database layer to an auto-updating electron app. The app handles a alot of relational data, so I used Normalizer to flatten and transform the data for ease of use.

## Cover Letter

Hi there. I appreciate you looking at this cover letter and reviewing my application.

I think I fit this role because you want someone that has experience "delivering amazing UX/UI" and who has "Familiarity with principles of good UX, UI with design-centric thinking." Not only am I proficient in React, but I am the interim UX designer and I have freelanced web design in the past. Part of my motto is making things pretty and causing delight. As such, I care about making a product that feels right, and I have the chops to pull it off.

Thanks for considering me for this role. I look forward to hearing more about it.
