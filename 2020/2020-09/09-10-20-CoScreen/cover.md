Hi Jon,

I think I fit this role because in my short career I have

- worked as a interim UX designer
- freelanced an electron/react app for a concrete project management
- and most recently created a electron/react medical device that is in hospitals accross the Midwest

Part of my motto is making things pretty and causing delight. I care about making a product that feels right, and I have the chops to pull it off!

Thanks for considering me for this role. I look forward to hearing more about it.
