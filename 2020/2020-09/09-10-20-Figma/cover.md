# Figma

## Please share 3-4 sentences on why you want to join Figma?

I am looking to join Figma because I have personally witnessed how it impacts UX <-> engineering relationships, I am interested in pushing the limits of a browser, and we are on the same page stylistically.

Hi there,

I want to be apart of continuing Figma's journey as an in-browser design tool. I believe I will contribute to its culture, and share the open-minded, user-focused mindset.

Thanks for considering me for the role.

PS. my areas of focus are 'Web application development' and 'UX design'
