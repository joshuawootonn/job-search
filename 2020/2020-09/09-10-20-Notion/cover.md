## What makes you want to work at Notion / Cover

Notion has taken a menial task and made it delightful. Part of the reason I take notes as much as I do is that Notion takes a lot of the pain out of it. I am seeking a team of people that care about making the userâ€™s life better, and I believe Notion is a great option for that.

Additionally, the cascading mental model that Notion is built on is technically intriguing to me. I would love to see how it is accomplished and see how I can contribute.

Thanks for considering me for this role. I look forward to hearing more about it.
