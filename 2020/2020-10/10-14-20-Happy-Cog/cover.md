Happy Cog stuck out to me because I am currently reading Linchpin by Seth Godin. The idea of what it means to take extreme ownership of a project and to not just follow the rules has changed my perspective for the better and helped me not take for granted the varienty of problems that I have been able to solve.

Over the last three years I have freelanced a labor tracking electron app, worked on branding and design for a ministry I am apart of, and had fun with a lot of tools like Figma, Gatsby, Next.js, and Three.js. All while working as a frontend engineer and shipping a delightful medical device into hospitals across the Mid-West.

I know how to handle hard problems and find solutions that are empathy driven.

Thanks for getting this far, the fact that you read is probably an indicator that we would get along. Looking forward to the first interview and learning more.
