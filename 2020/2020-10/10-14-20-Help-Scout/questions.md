# Questions

## What city and country do you live in?

I live in Iowa City, IA, USA

## How did you hear about the role

I heard about this role from a former mentor of mine. I recently signed on with a startup but was unable to agree with all the terms they presented. He suggested Help Scout because we care a lot about culture and Help Scout's ad impressed us both.

## Why do you want to work at Help Scout

My current job search goal is to find a small team, that is looking to positively impact peopleâ€™s lives while fostering genuine business transparency. I believe technology has the potential to connect us and create a better tomorrow. I want to be apart of a company that walks that walk. 

## In 3 or 4 sectences, please tell us your favorite thing about JS and why

Two things for me.

Array manipulation is easy! Map, Reduce, Slice, Splice, Unshift, Shift, so many simple ways of altering lists immutably.

I also love the community aspect of JS. I have experience with .NET and the community just doesn't have the same 'group of buddies working together' that I get from JS. 

## Please write a production-ready JavaScript function that determines if a string starts with an upper-case letter A-Z

const getIsStartingWithCapitalLetter =  value => !!value.match(/^[A-Z]/g)
