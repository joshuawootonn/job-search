Quora has been a sweet place for the past few years to find answers to weird problems, find subject matter experts, and learn in a whole new way. I would love the opportunity to contribute my skillset to making Quora even more delightful and fun!

Why would you hire me?

I have unique experience freelancing multiple products and spear heading the frontend of a delightful medical device that just got released this past May. I know how to deliver and my knowledge of your stack is extensive.

Would love an opportunity to share more of my experience and learn more about this role!
