Hi there! 
GIS popped onto the map for me last fall when I was reading through Designing Data-Intensive Applications. I had had an idea for a Microsoft Paint like canvas that users could interact with in real-time. To store the brush strings (linestrings) I wanted a database that would allow me to two-dimensionally search based on the userâ€™s location relative to the canvas. I used PostGIS for the implementation, but ESRI came up when I discussed it with my boss.

I am applying to ESRI because I have a passion for making remarkable tools, and I would love a chance to do that for a field I believe in.


Why would you hire me? 
> Knowledge of web visualization, user interface, and user experience development
yes, at my current position I am the interim UX designer
> Proficient with JavaScript
once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my Javascript skills were "Godlike"

I have some freelance work you can check out on my portfolio: joshuawootonn.com
My stats are in the attached resume
Thanks for your consideration,
Josh
