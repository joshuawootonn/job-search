Hi there! 

My name is Josh and I am applying for the Product Engineer role. I first heard about physiological safety last summer. I was on a team with a varied group of people, but starting with “are you mad, sad, glad, or afraid?” fostered a connection I hope to replicate again and again in my life. I love finding tools that actually help real people, but I think the market for remarkable tools is actually small and something I want to invest in. I believe Range is in a unique position to fulfill both of these desires.
The cherry on top is getting to collaborate on the design. I have worked as an interim UX designer at my current job. Design is essential and something I take personally. 

I have some freelance work you can check out on my portfolio: joshuawootonn.com
My stats are in the attached resume
Thanks for your consideration,
Josh
