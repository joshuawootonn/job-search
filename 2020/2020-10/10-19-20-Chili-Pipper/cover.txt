It's refreshing to see a product that clearly started with the need and was built backward from there. I believe Product === Team and Chili Piper's success is no accident. I am excited to create tools, learn with the best, and embody empathy for co-workers and customers. I think that ChiliPiper is a great place to do that.

Why would you hire me?

> Strong proficiency in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation
Once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my Javascript skills were "Godlike."

> Thorough understanding of React.js
I would hope so! I have used it in web apps, websites, electron apps in both the freelance and team context. 

> Self-motivated and self-directed; Fast learner
I have been described as a sponge. I might not know it all, but I try to own what I don't and learn it.


I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am looking forward to learning more about Chili Piper
