I love the bright colors and use of Gotham on HyperSceince.com. I just created a product that uses Gotham, and my portfolio's design system has lots of shapes, fun colors, and a geometic font.

These two thoughts combine under a belief of mine that Product === Team. The opportunity to create tools with like minded people is exciting!

I could go on, but I'll save that for the first interview. I am really looking forward to learning more about Hyper Science
