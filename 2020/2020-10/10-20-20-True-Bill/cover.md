## Final
Hi there!

My name is Josh, and I love making tools that help real people. I believe the personal finance space is lacking in remarkable tools and Truebill can change that!

Over the past year I have gained experience with tools like Segment, MixPanel, and Google Analytics. It's been a journey to see how much traffic I can get in my freelance work, and observe user behaviour in IDx-DR, my latest fulltime work.

I have solid chops in TS with production experience in MySQL, but I think what makes me the best fit for this job, is that I can take an abstract problem, condense input from the stakeholders, and create a simple solution.
