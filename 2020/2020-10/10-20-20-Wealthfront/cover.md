Why are you interested in Wealthfront? 

I read A Random Walk Down Wall Street last summer and was inspired. I felt empowered to invest on my own, but wanted to be laser focused on growing technically, so I invested through Wealthfront. I have been super impressed since then. Not only have my investments blossomed, but your user journey is delightful. I believe people = product and I am looking for team like yours to grow with and a product like Wealthfront that I believe in.
