## My Intro
Interested in Frontend Engineering positions at Wealthfront
Hi Weston,

I realize you don't have any open Frontend Engineer roles, but I wanted to PM you anyways because I am very interesting in Wealthfront.

Why am I interested?

I read A Random Walk Down Wall Street last summer and was inspired. I felt empowered to invest on my own, but wanted to be laser focused on growing technically,
so I invested through Wealthfront. I have been super impressed since then. Not only have my investments blossomed, but your user journey is delightful.
I'll put it this way: I want to work with the people that made such a good product.

Why should you give me a shot?

> I have a strong eye for design
1. I have been working hand in hand with a designer for the past year and recently I have taken his place as the interim UX designer.
2. I freelance web design so even in my free time I am honing those skills (check it out https://joshuawootonn.com)

> I have a strong grasp of the js and the web
1. Once, after a technical interview, the interviewer said that my JavaScript skills were "Godlike"
2. I am proficient at TS and React

Full disclosure I am looking for remote work, and according to review by my mentor and a recent technical interview I am a strong mid-level frontend engineer.

If you made it this far, thanks for giving me a shot! Check out the details in the resume attached.

Josh
