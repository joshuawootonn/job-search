Hi there!

My name is Josh and I love making tools that help real people. I believe the online editor space is lacking in remarkable tools and I believe Repl.it can change that.

What stands out about me is my knack for UX. Through my freelance experience, I have learned how to create delightful solutions while maintaining stakeholder input.

I am looking to work remotely since my wife is finishing her degree.
