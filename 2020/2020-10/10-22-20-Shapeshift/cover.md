Hi there!

Applying to ShapeShift because it seems like a culture that fosters autonomy and creativity. Something different about me is that I have acted as an interim UX designer in the past and I have been doing freelance UX design recently. I am frontend and visually focused, but enjoy working throughout the stack with the core principle of user delight in mind regardless of whether that user is a customer or a coworker.

Thanks for considering me,
Josh
