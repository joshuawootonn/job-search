Hi there, my name is Josh. I am known to be radically honest, I have ambitions for big real-world impact, and my frontend priority is always to make something delightful. I think our values align
nicely and Brexâ€™s vision for turning business finance on its head is exciting.

I fill this role nicely because I am coming from a similar size company. I know how to make my own map and chart the course through the unknowns and obstacles. I have experience working with products directly and have even filled in as the interim UX designer when our designer was overbooked.

Filling in as a designer and freelancing my own creative development has given me a lot of hours in design tools like Figma, Illustrator, and recently After Effects.

I appreciate your consideration. I know I have fewer years out of college, but I meet that with bold resolve to prove myself and be a strong return on a risky investment.

Josh
