Applying to Digital Ocean is exciting to me because I love the brand and have been a long time user. For personal projects, I am currently using 3 different droplets and a managed database. I always come back to Digital Ocean because I can see the results of a user-centric vision, my experience has always been delightful.

My mentor refers to me as a sponge. While I donâ€™t know everything, what I do know is how to make my own map and chart the course through the unknowns and obstacles. 

Coming from a startup, the idea of working closely with designers, product managers, and other engineers to make things happen is what I am used to and excited to continue.

Thanks for your consideration!
Josh
