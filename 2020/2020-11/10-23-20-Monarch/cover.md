Been using Monarch for the past few months and officially switched over from Mint a month ago. My wife and I literally want to financially check-in every Saturday, because of Monarch is delightful. I think the personal finance space is lacking in remarkable tools, and I want to join Monarch because it has a great chance to change that.

If you have gotten this far, I really appreciate your consideration. I know I have fewer years out of college and personally consider myself a strong mid-level engineer, but I meet this with bold resolve to prove myself and be a strong return on a risky investment.

My mentor refers to me as a sponge. While I donâ€™t know everything, what I do know is how to make my own map and chart the course through the unknowns and obstacles that startups face.

Something unique about me is my relatively extensive design experience. I have filled in as the interim UX designer when our designer was overbooked and currently freelance my own creative development. When I have a mid-life crisis I will probably become a UX designer, because I want to make things people will have fun using.
