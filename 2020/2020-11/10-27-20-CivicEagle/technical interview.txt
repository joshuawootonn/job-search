Mostly just ingesting bills

Looking to ingest more information about legistlative

Team is flat and sparse

Haydn is working on infra and data pipeline

IC = Individual Contributor

Haydn seems tired.

Product needs more frontend than backend.

Alex is primarily backend.

Just moved to mono repo style.



# Why Haydn joined?

Crypto -> Governance -> We don't understand enough about bills

Jesse (CDO) -> been around for a while -> found nina alex, ratly came from a bootcamp he was teaching about

Haydn came from San Francisco -> got burnt out -> Civic Eagle is not like that

Civic Eagle is borderline non profit, salary is based on location and lower end.



# Where do you see Civic Eagle in two years?

want to build collaboration into environment, want to unify advocacy groups

this is the only open position

the idea for hiring in the near future is we will hire more once series A is reached
