# What is the salary band for the job

# I am looking to make a mutually beneficial deal before i get into the weeds on salary negotiation

# I think Chris attested to the value I could bring to Clearcover, I want to come to a place where we can both go home as winners


# Bluff is 130k - 150k

# My range is between 120k and 130k
Would love to be at 130k


# Reading 
* You do not start negotiating until you already have a Yes-If
* When people with hiring authority think of winners, they think of people like them who live and breathe this business thing.  They negotiate things as a matter of course: that is a major portion of the value they bring to the company.
