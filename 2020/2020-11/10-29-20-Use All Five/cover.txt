Hi Jason,

My name is Josh and I would love to work for Use All Five. I live on the fringe of design and frontend development and this a sweet opportunity to flex both sides of that. 

I am working on my first freelance website atm, so I would love to walk through that later in the interview process.

Check out my portfolio below or my codepen for some of the animations I have been working on recently.
