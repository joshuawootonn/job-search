Ask Bryce about specifics. Based on team.

ISG: Healthy mix. Alot of mid, some Senior and Junior.

Handleful of devs that are going full remote.

Deere contractors are equal to fulltime developers. Team is really inclusive to contractors. 



Kirby: Learning. learned alot about react, node, terraform, aws. Team has felt like a family.


ISG focuses on Op Center (Web App) all for the browser, some do mobile development.

Your strengths are also strongly considered in the role you fill.
