Hi there! 
My name is Josh and I would love to work for Articulate. It was refreshing to read about your culture! We both value empowering people with autonomy and respect.
Here are five more of my beliefs: 

1. Making something delightful should be the default
I believe that ‘it works’ is not good enough. How a product makes its user feel are just as important as it working in the first place.
2. Passion can compensate for experience
Some people say that I soak up new things like a sponge. I believe that my passion and energy have accelerated my growth to compensate for the years of experience I lack. 
3. If you want something you gotta bring it
I want to be a part of making a great culture. Two traits I value are being unashamedly myself and empathetic to others. This might look like me including that new Kanye song in a demo, wearing yellow all summer, or jumping in to help when a coworker is in distress.
4. Hard things are just easy things in succession
What really makes a problem hard is not being able to see the end of it. I have experience embracing the unknowns, iterating until the end is in sight, and moving forward even when my brain wants to remain paralyzed by fear.
5. All products are a reflection of the team
Ultimately, creating a great product is about aligning great people around a common focus. The above four beliefs are the blocks that I bring to your team.
