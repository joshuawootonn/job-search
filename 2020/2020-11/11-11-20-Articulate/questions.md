# Considering that Articulate is a diverse organization employing people from all over the world and with different backgrounds, talk about ways that you have worked to make others feel included?

I work to be inclusive by reaching out and pull people into my problem when I know they don't have work, or reach out and jumping into their problem when they have to much.

# When youâ€™ve joined a team in the past, what have you done to earn the trust of others?

I think that bringing your true self to work is the best way to build trust. Nothing breaks down social walls like leading the charge through them. My favorites are interducing your cat Thomas,sharing your music taste, and starting typing challenges only to lose to them becuase I can only type at 75wpm.

# Our culture is results driven, what does that mean to you and how do you measure your own success?

That's awesome. I think a lot of harm is caused by rationalization of our failures and exageration of our successes. Ultimately, I try to measure my own success objectively and from a clear mind. The specifics do vary, but for work it comes down to people I positively impact and obstacles I overcome.

# What is your proficiency with Ruby On Rails, React, JavaScript & (S)CSS?

I am an expert in React and have used it since 2017 in freelance, in school, and professionally.

I am an expert at JavaScript and have used it to create scripts, servers, electron apps, and web apps.

I am an expert at CSS but have been using CSS in JS for the past two years. I would need to brush up on some of the advanced syntax of SCSS.

I am familiar with Ruby On Rails. I did a bootcamp in college in it, took two classes with it, and used it at hackathons. My backend experience is mostly in .net core and node, but I am happy to learn fast given this opportunity!

# Are you familiar with responsive design, SEO, and accessibility concerns? If so, please elaborate

Freelancing has opened the door for me to learn about responsive design and SEO.

My best responsive and accessibility work is in a close sourced project unfortunately, but you can check out my portfolio https://joshuawootonn.com for an example of my proficiency.
