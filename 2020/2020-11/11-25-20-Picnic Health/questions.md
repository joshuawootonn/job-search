# Why do you want to join PicnicHealth?

I think having closer access to my health records would be helpful and I think your tool is delightful. I'm in the business of making delightful tools, so it seems like a mutually beneficial fit.

# In your eyes, what is the most critical element of a successful picnic?

Ideally someone you find attractive ðŸŒ¶ and some balmy weather â˜€

# Earliest start date?

December 7th, No current obligations as I am looking fulltime!

# Tell us about something you've built that you're proud of.

I recently made this pirate ship animation: https://codepen.io/joshuawootonn/pen/gOMNdzZ

Proud of it because I just recently started using Illustrator and I think the SVG turned out nicely!

I really like pirates. The sense of adventure and ownership that comes from being in the open sea with no friendly ports gets me excited. Looking for that same feeling in a company!
