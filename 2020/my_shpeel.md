# Elevator Pitch

My name is Josh; I have been working as a frontend engineer for the past 2 years. I chose frontend engineering because I love making things look pretty.
To me this is more than just making them look good, it's about making the experience have a positive emotional impact.
Recently, I have had the opportunity to work with a UI/UX designer. Working with him has not only challenged me creatively but also made me lean more into the design side of things.
So in my free time I currently am freelancing web design for local companies. After work I enjoy running, being in nature,
spending time with my wife, and playing with my cat Thomas. He is really cute, which sometimes makes up for the fact that he is not a dog
That's me in a nut shell.

# Digital Diagnostics / Frontend Engineer

### How it started

Started working at IDx (it was recently rebranded) in 2017, for my internships I worked in on some different C# tooling, and then for the past year and a half I have worked as a frontend engineer.

### Why I want to move on

C suite has completely flipped since we got venture capital. Many of the things I enjoyed about the company have changed: teams got shuffled, a lot of good people left, C suite attitude was toxic

##### Created a React web app to replace the Windows Forms version IDx-DR. It was off the books at first, but soon gained steam and became the flagship product

I had this quirky mentor at the time, and the project we were working on became unneeded because some the need for it was born out of a miss communication in the C suite.
We were all kinda bummed, and he suggested I create a web version of the legacy product we had that had a lot of usability issues. I did, posted a demo in chat.
It just took off from there, I have been the head frontend engineer on that project since.

##### Iterated designs in Figma, implemented designs in Electron/React, and tested implementation in Cypress / Spectron

A UI/UX designer joined the team in December. He iterated the project with me, we had many discussions about his process and rational. He had worked as a frontend engineer in the past, and had a good number of testing opinions. Learned a lot on how to make a comprehensive test suite that doesn't include stupid test, but also cover edges.

##### Played a pivotal role in features like image snapshot testing, end to end testing, darkmode, and interactive animation

Like I said been the head frontend engineer on that project since it started. My role included these frontend tasks, but I also played a part in the backend service. Our app is an electron/react frontend with a .NET CORE backend.
I did with node at this job was a cli tool for moving images on dev machines for different exam cases (disease, no disease, poor image quality) and a tool for generating license attributions from all the open source/3rd party code we are using

# All American Concrete / Software Engineer

### How it started

Started working at AACI in college as a concrete contract estimator, I had extra time and they were always complaining about how employees would manipulate their paper system to get extra time on their time sheet.
I proposed a solution, which was a Qt application that the employees could use in the shop, and estimators could interact with in the office.

### Why I want to move on

Was looking for a more professional position that included mentorship

##### Created a labor tracking app call Time Track that facilitates 60 employees to track work, 3 estimators to view analytics, and 1 secretary to automate payroll

##### Developed an initial version that used Qt / C++ / MySql

- C++/Qt - my best langauge at the time
- deployed initial version in 2017 after a year of part time work.
- mistakes: sql structure, lack of c++ fines, and lack of resources

##### Migrated the old version to use Electron / React / Node / MySql enabling better analytics, sleeker UI, and more intuitive UX

- Updated because - wanted to pick something that I could make more maintainable for their future. my c++ is ok :D
- Electron/React - my new strong suite. I knew I could iterate rapidly with it.
- Loopback - most operations were crud and so generated the routes seemed promising
- Deployed originally last year on Digital Ocean
- Have been pushing occasional updates with more analytic features.

# Graze Analytics / Software Engineer

### How it started

This was a senior design project at university that allowed you to scan a bar code on your restaurant tab, pay and rate online, and leave without interacting with your server.

### Why I want to move on

We had won many pitch competitions, but our capital without investment was around 25k. Personally, I was looking for interesting work, not an entrepreneurial pipe dream so there was no reason for me to go in

##### Designed a product that allowed users to pay for their meal without interacting with a waiter

- trial run at a local restaurant
- fizzing out because of lack of capital

##### Created a React app to collect payment through Stripe and feedback through an Ant Design based form

- Omnivore - POS integration that allowed us to get QR codes on receipts
- React app - What we were all good at. allowed us to gather payment for customers and feedback for restaurant

##### Developed a Node / MySql backend for coordinating Stripe and Omnivore transactions, while storing analytics data for restaurants

- Express.js - Api that listened to webhook from Omnivore, created a session and worked with Omnivore to get a QR code on the receipt.
