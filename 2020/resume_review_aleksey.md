resume: descriptions of what you did was good


The flaw is you are indistinguishable from other engineers

You want to be remarkable. How do I make this more remarkable?

Frontend Engineer w/ good eye for detail or w/ some talent for design work or w/ a knack for UX


You are not just some ave frontend engineer. How do you show that.


Remarkable information can also go on your cover letter. 

Cover letter should include what you are looking for in a company. Not in a tired boring way, but in a fun creative way.

Imagine the person on the other side as someone you want to work with. Make a human connection.


When looking for a job look for the things that you value in the ad itself. 
They put hooks in that ad, tell them that you took the bait

You just need one

Treat it as an ongoing project

Sr. vs Mid level. Let them determine it. if you love them still go for it

Your title is fluid. change it to what you need to look good to company. 
it is a summary of what you did in their terms not in some standard

I wouldn't omit freelance from  resume either in summarized form. only include noteable work

retarget website to job search to whta you are looking for and have a suburl for freelance projects

case studies, including thought process and video demos

articles, case studies, these are the things that will actually set you appart. showing you are one of the few that cares enough
