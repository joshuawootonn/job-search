1.How can I make this resume more exceptional?

1. Don't use two-column, it just leaves out a lots of spaces and makes it hard to read
2. You can add a summary section at the very beginning. Write about 3 lines of paragraph summarizing what jobs you are looking for, and what is your qualification for such job.
3. Add locations for each experience
4. The "Strength" section can be renamed as "Skills" section. Also, no need to write soft skills, they are looking for your technical skills on your resume
2.Is there anything that makes you question my credibility?

I know that you are applying for a frontend position, but seeing that you only know JS and C# definitely makes people frown upon. You should at least know one of Python/Java/C/C++ which are the major languages. Maybe try learning Python, it's really easy to get started with.
Also, when writing about your work experiences, you wrote about what you did, but you should write more about the impact/achievement of your work, that's what people are looking for.
3.I believe that I bring a lot of charisma and I want to be involved in the design process. Should I convey this in a 'me' section at the top? If not how can I convey this?

I'm not sure what you want to achieve here. What you need is to get interviews, then pass interview, and if you want to get involved in the design process, that's something you do once you actually join the company, not something you tell people when applying for jobs.
Since we are trying to get a software engineer job here, the key is to show your strong technical skills not your charisma.
4.Is posting a resume in pdf form the norm or is there another format?

Yes, you should always be giving pdf instead of docx since not everyone has Word installed on their computers. In fact, you probably can't upload docx when applying jobs for most companies. When I see people uploading docx and asking for resume reviews and I'm on my Mac it always frustrated me.
5.Can you give my current resume an out of 10 rating? Be ruthless and point out what needs to change the most

I would say 5 or 6 out of 10.
Definitely makes all the changes I just mentioned, and the weakest points are the two I mentioned in answer 2. You should really learn one of Python/Java/C/C++, and change the write up of your work experiences. Also, maybe at least four bullet points for each experiences, once you change to 1-column you should have enough space to add more content
