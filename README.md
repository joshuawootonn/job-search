Welcome to my job search repo... now and in the future this repo will be a publicly visible testiment to the WWWWH of my looking for that bread.

Why am I doing this? I like data and I want to have a centralized location for my own. Additionally, I want to provide transparency as I continue in my career for people that are trying to follow a similar path.
